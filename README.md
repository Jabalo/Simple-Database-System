# Simple Database System

THIS IS A SIMPLE DATABASE APPLICATION TO ORGANIZE THE ANIME TITLES I HAVE WATCHED.

INTRUCTIONS:
    - ADD DATA will add new entries to database and requires a unique TITLE.
    - DELETE DATA will delete an entry by TITLE.
    - READ DATA will return a list of all entries in the database.
    - GET DATA will filter all entries depending on TITLE, GENRE, or RATING.
    - MODIFY DATA will allow user to modify an entry by TITLE, GENRE, or RATING.
