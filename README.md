# Simple Database System

THIS IS A SIMPLE DATABASE APPLICATION TO ORGANIZE THE ANIME TITLES I HAVE WATCHED.<br />

INTRUCTIONS:<br />
    - ADD DATA will add new entries to database and requires a unique TITLE.<br />
    - DELETE DATA will delete an entry by TITLE.<br />
    - READ DATA will return a list of all entries in the database.<br />
    - GET DATA will filter all entries depending on TITLE, GENRE, or RATING.<br />
    - MODIFY DATA will allow user to modify an entry by TITLE, GENRE, or RATING.<br />
